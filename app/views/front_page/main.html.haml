    I am Joel Graycar, a third-year Computer Science major at the University of California, Berkeley. Please feel free to browse through a few of the projects I have worked on since I began programming in 2012, and to contact me at [jgraycar@berkeley.edu](jgraycar@berkeley.edu) with any questions or inquiries.
